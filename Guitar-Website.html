 	<br>guitar is a fretted musical instrument that typically has six strings. It is held flat against the player's body and played by strumming or plucking the strings with the dominant hand, while simultaneously pressing selected strings against frets with the fingers of the opposite hand. A plectrum or individual finger picks may be used to strike the strings. The sound of the guitar is projected either acoustically, by means of a resonant chamber on the instrument, or amplified by an electronic pickup and an amplifier.<br>

 	<h2>Type's of Guitar</h2>
    There are three main types of modern guitar.
    the are; <br>
    1] Classical Guitar{Normal Guitar}<br>
    2] Electric Guitar<br>
    3] Bass Guitar<br>

    <h3>Classical Guitar {Normal Guitar}</h3>
      *What is a normal guitar called?<br>
      To a classical guitarist, they would call a normal guitar a classical guitar or nylon string guitar. To a folk or country guitarist, they would call a normal guitar a steel-string acoustic. To a rock or metal guitarist, they would call a normal guitar an electric guitar.<br>

     An acoustic guitar is a musical instrument in the guitar family. Its strings vibrate a sound board on a resonant body to project a sound wave through the air. The original, general term for this stringed instrument is guitar, and the retronym 'acoustic guitar' distinguishes it from an electric guitar, which relies on electronic amplification. Typically, a guitar's body is a sound box, of which the top side serves as a sound board that enhances the vibration sounds of the strings. In standard tuning the guitar's six strings are tuned (low to high) E2 A2 D3 G3 B3 E4.<br>

     Guitar strings may be plucked individually with a pick (plectrum) or fingertip, or strummed to play chords. Plucking a string causes it to vibrate at a fundamental pitch determined by the string's length, mass, and tension. (Overtones are also present, closely related to harmonics of the fundamental pitch.) The string causes the soundboard and the air enclosed by the sound box to vibrate. As these have their own resonances, they amplify some overtones more strongly than others, affecting the timbre of the 
     resulting sound.<br>

    <h3>Electric Guitar</h3>
     When an electric guitar is played, string movement produces a signal by generating (i.e., inducing) a small electric current in the magnetic pickups, which are magnets wound with coils of very fine wire. The signal passes through the tone and volume circuits to the output jack, and through a cable to an amplifier.<br>

     electric guitar is a guitar that requires external amplification in order to be heard at typical performance volumes, unlike a standard acoustic guitar. It uses one or more pickups to convert the vibration of its strings into electrical signals, which ultimately are reproduced as sound by loudspeakers. The sound is sometimes shaped or electronically altered to achieve different timbres or tonal qualities from that of an acoustic guitar. Often, this is done through the use of effects such as reverb, distortion and "overdrive"; the latter is considered to be a key element of electric blues guitar music and rock guitar playing.<br>
 

Invented in 1932, the electric guitar was adopted by jazz guitar players, who wanted to play single-note guitar solos in large big band ensembles. Early proponents of the electric guitar on record include Les Paul, Lonnie Johnson, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, T-Bone Walker, and Charlie Christian. During the 1950s and 1960s, the electric guitar became the most important instrument in popular music.[1] It has evolved into an instrument that is capable of a multitude of sounds and styles in genres ranging from pop and rock to country music, blues and jazz. It served as a major component in the development of electric blues, rock and roll, rock music, heavy metal music and many other genres of music.<br>


Electric guitar design and construction varies greatly in the shape of the body and the configuration of the neck, bridge, and pickups. Guitars may have a fixed bridge or a spring-loaded hinged bridge, which lets players "bend" the pitch of notes or chords up or down, or perform vibrato effects. The sound of an electric guitar can be modified by new playing techniques such as string bending, tapping, and hammering-on, using audio feedback, or slide guitar playing.<br>

<h3>Bass Guitar</h3><br>
 
The bass guitar, electric bass or simply bass, is the lowest-pitched member of the guitar family. It is a plucked string instrument similar in appearance and construction to an electric or an acoustic guitar, but with a longer neck and scale length, and typically four to six strings or courses. Since the mid-1950s, the bass guitar has largely replaced the double bass in popular music <br>

Since the mid-1950s, the bass guitar has largely replaced the double bass in popular music.<br>

The four-string bass is usually tuned the same as the double bass, which corresponds to pitches one octave lower than the four lowest-pitched strings of a guitar (E, A, D, and G). It is played primarily with the fingers or thumb, or with a pick. In order to be heard at normal performance volumes, electric basses require external amplification.<br>

          <h1>The History of the Guitar</h1>

            The music industry is constantly evolving and revolutionizing. Changes in the audience’s taste and musicians’ desires to experiment<br>

            have forced the musical world to modernize and create new instruments to meet demands, from the theremin in the 1920s to the latest apps found on the laptops of electronic musicians. But one thing has remained constant this entire time: the centrality of the guitar, the most popular instrument in the world. Guitars are the nucleus of the music industry and it’s impossible to dispute the pride of place it has in many musical genres, from folk to heavy metal. Despite all the new instruments crowding the market, the guitar is still the most played instrument in the world and continues to be a favorite for youngsters who want to start playing.
<br>
            <h1>History of the Guitar: Origins</h1> <br>
            The history of the guitar, with some variations, traces back more than 4000 years. There are many theories about its origins: many believe that it’s an enhanced model of an ancient instrument called the “lute,” which was used to play folk and traditional songs, while others see it as a relative of the Greek “kithara.” While compelling, prestigious music historians such as Dr. Michael Kasha, have proved these accounts to be unreliable.<br>
            <br>
            Things start getting much clearer, however, once archeologists discovered the guitar’s oldest ancestor: a string instrument named the “tanbur.” The tanbur has, with some differences, the shape of the guitar. These instruments eventually evolved into the Oud, which spread into the Arabic islands. Later, Europeans adopted the instrument and added some frets to enhance its look. They christened it the lute, paying tribute to its Arabic name, Al-Oud (meaning “perfumed wood”)<br>
            <h1>THE LUTE</h1><br>

            The lute’s popularity eventually gave way to the guitar; named after the Sanskrit word for “string.” The instrument became very popular in many European countries during the 16th and 17th centuries. While most people are roughly familiar with acoustic and electric guitars; the instrument continues to boast a wide range of variations. From Contrabass to treble! ( Famous in Europe and Latin America). The twelve-string guitar has six double courses placed in standard tuning. The Hawaii Guitar or steel guitar is laid across the knees of the player instead of propped upright. And, of course, there is the famous electric guitar; played mostly in rock music but not unheard of in jazz and other genres. It’s a solid, non-vibrating body guitar made of steel<br>
